# PDF-to-Voice-API
"PDF-to-Voice API" is an API that converts PDF documents into audio. It extracts text from PDFs using PyPDF, and if the PDF contains images instead of text, it applies OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using Tesseract. The extracted text is then converted into speech, providing an accessible audio output for users.
